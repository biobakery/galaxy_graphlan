.. class:: infomark

Please refer to the "Load input tree" Galaxy module above for an introduction to GraPhlAn and input examples.

.. class:: infomark

Like the "Annotate tree" module, this step can be recursively applied. 

.. class:: infomark

The "Ring input file" should be loaded with the general Galaxy upload module, and it should have the syntax described below.

.. class:: infomark

**Input examples:** small input files for the guide.txt_ and phylo_small.xml_ trees are available (guide_rings.txt_ and phylo_small_rings.txt_). Just load one of these files with the standard Galaxy load module and specify it as "Ring input File" above (remember to use the corresponding tree as "Input Tree"). A partial working excerpt of this file is also displayed below.


**What it does**


We call rings the graphical elements external to the tree itself that can be
seen as "circular heatmaps", "circular barplots", and similar elements (like
indicator elements). These "rings" are linked directly to the internal tree as
each segment of the rings correspond to a tree leaf (and potentially to internal
nodes as well). Multiple rings can be specified for the same image and each must
have a progressive associated number (level "1" being the most internal ring).

The general syntax for rings is:

``[clade_name]	ring_option	ring_level	ring_option_value``

If clade_name is not present or if it is "*" the ring option is applied to all
the ring sectors in the "ring_level". The "ring_level" is a integer number that
must always be specified.

Here is a tiny example for annotating one ring of the guide.txt_ tree with a partial heatmap of Geobacillus and a barplot for Listeria (make sure to maintain the tab between columns if you copy-and-paste into the galay Load module)

| ``Bacillaceae.Geobacillus.Gkaustophilus	ring_color	1	#AAAA00``
| ``Bacillaceae.Geobacillus.Gthermodenitrificans	ring_color	1	#AAAA00``
| ``Bacillaceae.Geobacillus.Gthermoglucosidasius	ring_color	1	#AAAA00``
| ``Bacillaceae.Geobacillus.Gkaustophilus	ring_alpha	1	0.08``
| ``Bacillaceae.Geobacillus.Gthermodenitrificans	ring_alpha	1	0.91``
| ``Bacillaceae.Geobacillus.Gthermoglucosidasius	ring_alpha	1	0.16``
| ``Listeriaceae.Listeria.Lgrayi	ring_height	2	0.81``
| ``Listeriaceae.Listeria.Linnocua	ring_height	2	0.80``
| ``Listeriaceae.Listeria.Lmonocytogenes	ring_height	2	0.97``
| ``Listeriaceae.Listeria.Lseeligeri	ring_height	2	0.89``
| ``Listeriaceae.Listeria.Lwelshimeri	ring_height	2	1.52``


And here is the definition of all the possible ring options:

``ring_color`` [def. black] : the color of the ring segment 

``ring_width`` [def. 1.0] : the width of the ring segment a fraction of the total circular width available for the specific clade

``ring_height`` [def. highest height for the rings in the same level, or 0.1 if no heights are specific] : the height of the circular segment. If not specific the same default height (0.1*size of the tree) is applied for all ring segment in the level, otherwise the height is equal to the biggest height value in the level.

``ring_alpha`` [def. 1.0]: the transparency value. 0.0 means completely transparent (thus invisible), 1.0 means completely opaque (no transparencies) 

``ring_shape`` [def. R]: the shape of the ring. Default is 'R' for rectangular which means that the whole available area is used. The alternatives are currently 'v' or '^' which mean triangular shape (with opposite directions) that can be used as pointing arrow for highlighting specific clades. 

``ring_edge_width`` [def 0.1]: the width of the border of the ring segment

``ring_edge_color`` [def None, which means 'ring_color']: the color of the border of the ring segment

Some additional ring options refer to non clade-specific aspects like the label of the ring itself or the graphical separation between rings. These options are specified without a clade name in the following tree-column format:

``global_ring_option     ring_level      global_ring_option_value``

Specifically, the ring options can be:

``ring_label`` [def. None]: the label to be displayed at "stat_rotation" position for the rings. total_plotted_degrees should be less than 360 to make space for these labels

``ring_label_color`` [def. black]: the color of the ring label

``ring_label_font_size`` [def. 11]: the font size of the ring labels

``ring_internal_separator_thickness`` [def.  0.0 which means absent]: the thickness of the circular line separating different ring levels. This is referred to the most internal of the two sides of each ring.

``ring_external_separator_thickness`` [def.  0.0 which means absent]: the thickness of the circular line separating different ring levels. This is referred to the most external of the two sides of each ring.

``ring_separator_color`` [def. 'k' for black]: the color of the circular line separating different ring levels.
